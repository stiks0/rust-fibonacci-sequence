# 🌀 Simple Fibonacci Sequence Tool 🛠️

This is a basic line tool created in Rust to produce the Fibonacci sequence up to a length chosen by the user.

## ℹ️ How It Functions

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers where each number is the total of the two before it, often starting with 0 and 1. That is:

$$ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) $$
